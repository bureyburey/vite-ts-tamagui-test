This will include a DJ, drag queens, VIPs, and much more. <br>- Hyatt colleague event + marching – Sunday, June 26 afternoon. This will include 100+ Hyatt employees at Park South hotel having brunch, mingling, applying glitter and much more. We want to capture the interactions between colleagues. A couple hours later, the colleagues will be marching through the streets of NYC accompanied by a float. The float will have intermitted confetti blasts and we would love for the photographer to capture the blast, plus the colleagues walking with the float. We expect the photographer to walk with us on the parade route.<br><br>",
